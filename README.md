Abstract 

With the rapid evolution of financial technology, accurately predicting the approval of home mortgage loan applications has become crucial for banks and financial institutions to optimize their core operations. This project is a quintessential binary classification challenge, aiming to employ the HMDA (Home Mortgage Disclosure Act) dataset to build machine learning models that forecast the success rate of loan applications. The binary classification task hinges on determining whether a loan will be approved or not, based on a range of features provided by the HMDA dataset, including applicant information, loan amounts, property details, and geographical locations.

The project commences with thorough data preprocessing, which involves addressing missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing features to create a robust foundation for the modeling process. Subsequent to preprocessing, a slew of machine learning algorithms—such as Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Trees, and Logistic Regression—are deployed to tackle this binary classification task. The efficacy of these models is meticulously gauged using metrics like accuracy, recall, and F1 score, which are particularly vital in evaluating binary classifiers. In addition, an analysis of feature importance is conducted to shed light on the predictive power of each feature, thereby offering invaluable guidance for the formulation of future credit policies.

The anticipated outcome of this project is the enhancement of financial institutions' capabilities to make precise loan approval decisions, effectively mitigate risks, and consequently, elevate customer satisfaction. Moreover, an in-depth analysis of the HMDA dataset is projected to uncover significant trends and patterns within the mortgage market, which can yield actionable insights for policy-making. In essence, the research findings are expected to further the advancement of inclusive financial services, contributing to the establishment of a fair and transparent housing loan market landscape.
