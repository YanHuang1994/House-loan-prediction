Abstract 

As financial technology rapidly evolves, accurately predicting the approval of home mortgage loan applications is crucial for banks and financial institutions to optimize their core operations. This project aims to utilize the HMDA (Home Mortgage Disclosure Act) dataset to build machine learning models to forecast the success rate of loan applications. The HMDA dataset encompasses a wealth of features including applicant information, loan amounts, property details, and geographical locations.
The project begins with data preprocessing, addressing missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing features. Subsequently, a variety of machine learning algorithms such as Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Trees, and Logistic Regression are employed to model the dataset. The performance of these models is evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, recall, and F1 score. Furthermore, feature importance analysis will offer guidance for future credit policy formulation.
It is anticipated that this project will enable financial institutions to precisely predict loan approval decisions, reduce risks, and enhance customer satisfaction. Moreover, analyzing the HMDA dataset is expected to reveal trends and patterns in the mortgage market, providing insights for policy-making. Ultimately, the research outcomes will advance inclusive financial services, aiding in the creation of a fair and transparent housing loan market environment.
