    "The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) requires many **financial institutions** to **maintain, report, and publicly disclose loan-level information** about **mortgages**. These **data help** show whether **lenders** are **serving** the **housing needs** of their communities; they **give** public officials **information** that **helps** them **make decisions and policies**; and they shed light on lending patterns that could be discriminatory. The **public data** are **modified** to **protect** applicant and borrower **privacy**.\n",

    "In general, the **primary purposes** of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C are to **monitor the geographic targets of mortgage lenders**, **provide** an **identification mechanism** for any predatory **lending practices**, and to **provide** reporting **statistics** on the mortgage market **to** the **government**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The HMDA requires certain financial institutions to collect and report data on mortgage loan applications, originations, purchases, and other related activities. The data collected through LAR includes information about the loan applicant, the property, and the loan itself.\n",
